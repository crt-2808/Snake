# Snake
## The Snake Game using Turtle Graphics is an interactive Python project that recreates the classic Snake game, where players control a snake that grows longer as it consumes food while avoiding collisions with walls and itself. This project leverages the Turtle graphics library in Python to create a visually appealing and engaging gaming experience.

## Key Features:

- Snake Movement: The project allows players to control the movement of the snake using arrow keys or other designated keys. The snake moves continuously in the direction specified by the player until redirected.

- Food Generation: The game randomly generates food (represented by a colored square or circle) on the screen for the snake to consume. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer.

- Collision Detection: The project includes collision detection mechanisms to check if the snake collides with the boundaries of the game window (walls) or itself. Collisions result in the end of the game.

- Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases every time the snake eats food. The score is displayed on the screen during gameplay.

- Game Over Screen: When the snake collides with a wall or itself, the game ends, and a "Game Over" screen is displayed. This screen may show the player's final score and provide options to play again or exit the game.

- User Interface: The game interface utilizes Turtle graphics to create a visually appealing display, including the snake, food, score, and game over screen.
